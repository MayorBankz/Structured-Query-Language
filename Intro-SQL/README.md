## What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a computer language used to talk to databases.

A <em>database</em> is a place where information is stored, organized, and managed.

SQL helps you:
* Store data
* Find data
* Update data
* Delete data
* Organize data

## What SQL is used for?
SQL is used to:
1. Get information from a database
Example:
* "Show all customers"
* "Show sales for last week"

2. Add new information
Example
* Add a new user or product

3. Update Information
Example: Change someone's phone number

4. Delete information
Example: Remove an old record

5. Create and manage tables
Example: Tables are like spreadsheets inside a database


## How SQL Works 
A database has tables - rows and columns, just like Excel. Each table stores one type of information.
For Example:
* Customers Table
* id name phone
1. Ada 0801...
2. John 0802

SQL works by sending commands (called queries) to the database.
The database reads your command -- processes it -- gives you an answer

## Real-World Applications of SQL

SQL is used almost everywhere data exists
1. Banking
* Your data history is stored in a database
* SQL is used to check balances, update transfers, record payments
2. E-commerce / Online stores
* Products, orders, customers, and inventory are all managed with SQL
3. Social Media
* Your posts, likes, comments, messages -- stored in SQL databases
* Instagram, Tiktok, Facebook all use databases heavily

5. Hospitals

6. Telecom
